description: Minimalize is a dynamic typeface that was designed to embody the evolution of social media. Like with social media platforms, ‘Minimalize’ evolves based off of users engagement within a pre-defined system. Each time a user uses a character in their text, the character loses one of its axis points. The typeface continues to simplify until there is one a single line remaining, making the characters almost indistinguishable from one-another.
