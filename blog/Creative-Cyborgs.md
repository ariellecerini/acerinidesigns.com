description: The Makers of Nothing

---
'If we are honest with ourselves, nothing particularly significant has come out or the ‘maker movement,’ for anyone beyond its practitioners.'[1]

Preface:


The following text serves as both a reflection of my first year of doctoral studies, as well as a restructuring of my research paradigm; in a way, it is a rewrite of my design manifesto. This is a ‘living’ document, forever-changing based on my own individual experiences; however, it is a statement of my purpose. It is through study and exploration that I hope to expand my understanding of this Post-Cartesian, interspecies, time-matrix.
While the ideas presented within this text are a reflection of my current perspective, and I am the writer of this document, I did not construct these concepts on my own. These ideas were realized through a series of conversations over the past year with J.A. Dowdall. They are the byproduct of an attempt to make sense of the nonsensical ramblings of a designer and a theorist.
Within this text, I make the assumption that you have read and/or have a working knowledge of Guy Debord’s Society of the Spectacle and Jean Bauldrillard’s Simulations. While there are some definitions and explanations provided as notes at the close of this document, having knowledge of these classic texts is recommended.
All-in-all, I want to reiterate that this is a living document and is representative of where I am on this journey that we call academia. Although it may not appear to be the case, I realize that I do not have all the answers, and as such this document does not claim to. I believe that it is through these reflective moments that we begin to realize and conceive our perspectives, and so this is my attempt to do so.
'This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill — the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill — you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I’m offering is the truth. Nothing more.'[2]

Blue Pill: Skip to the end of the document.


Red Pill: Continue on.


Creative Cyborgs: The Maker of Nothing

Cyborg. The cyborg is a ‘cybernetic organism.’[3] It is a hybrid, existing as both man and machine. 'A creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction.'[4] Here, in the Simulacra,[5] we are all creative cyborgs, expressive beings that have been dematerialized, forever in flux within the digital realm. I am one fractal[6] of a consciousness. A segment of the whole; a statistical replica of the origin. I exist within one dimension of ‘the real’:[7] a Post-Cartesian dematerialized reality. Here I lead a monotonous existence, outputting monotonous content into the abyss of monotony. All of you around me are hypnotized by the awe of the Spectacle,[8] content with your existence as the maker of ‘nothing.’
The Spectacle is the shaper of the Simulacra. You, as the maker of ‘nothing’ feed the Spectacle. Fueling it. Enabling it. And it, in turn, has used your ‘nothing’ to shape the pure simulacrum — divorcing it from all representations of reality.[9] The Simulacra exists within our Post-Cartesian reality. It is driven by the relationship of the Spectacle to the creative cyborg, Like the creative cyborg, the Spectacle is a fractal composed of fractals. “It is a concrete inversion of life, an autonomous movement of the non-living.”[10] The Simulacra has been dematerialized, removed from ‘the real,’ it is an illusion, grounded in deterministic chaos.[11] It is both predictable and unpredictable.
We, the creative cyborgs, exist within the referendum[12] of the Simulacra, where the referential[13] ceases to exist. Here in the referendum communication is binary, a literal interpretation of the sender-receiver model.[14] All that is not computational is removed, thought to be noise. Complexity is removed. Individuality is removed. Humanity is removed.[15] All that remains is the maker of ‘nothing,’ restructured to fit into their new conformed reality.
The Simulacra is all that is known. The “spectacular domination has succeeded in raising an entire generation molded to its laws.”[16] The creative cyborgs have little knowledge or recollection of life outside of the Simulacra. The power of the Spectacle, is all that we have ever known. The Simulacra has become the real, but it is not reality.[17] The Spectacle has been able to propel our movement towards the Simulacra through the accumulation of capital “to the point that it becomes images”[18]
You, the maker of ‘nothing,’ are but mere operators. You are the factory workers of Metropolis, offering up sacrifices to the machine.[19] You are vapid. You are basic. You are ignorant. But you are not to blame for your flaws. A victim to consumerism. Swayed by the serpent’s tongue, who hides its motives behind the sensorial awe, feeding off of insecurities and vain; luring you towards the forbidden fruit. The Spectacle has placed you into a trance, you are unconscious makers hypnotized by the illusions of the Spectacle.[20]
'When the real world is transformed into mere images, mere images become real beings — figments that provide the direct motivations for a hypnotic behavior. Since the spectacle’s job is to use various specialized mediations in order to show us a world that can no longer be directly grasped, it naturally elevates the sense of sight to the special preeminence once occupied by touch: the most abstract and easily decided sense is the most readily adaptable to the generalized abstraction of present-day society.'[21]
Here, within the Simulacra, you the maker of ‘nothing,’ are a simulation of the maker: making ‘nothing,’ yet making everything. “To simulate is not simply to feign… simulation threatens the difference between ‘true’ and ‘false,’ between the real and the imaginary….”[22] ‘Nothing’ is everything in the Simulacra. It is wealth. It is power. It is energy. It is relationships. It is identity. It is fame. Yet, it is still ‘nothing.’ Here in the Simulacra we live for ‘nothing,’ which means we live for everything. If the ‘nothingness’ were to stop, everything would stop. But what is everything if everything is ‘nothing?’
The ‘nothing’ is forever in flux, stripped from its aura. Reproduction has done what Walter Benjamin said it would, resulting in the substitution of a unique experience with a plurality of existence and the shattering of persistence.[23] The reproduction of art results in the loss of the aura of the work. ‘Nothing’ is perfect, and yet it is imperfect — flawed by its lack of error.
Making is “the universal infrastructure of production.”[24]It is the “…most powerful way that we solve problems, express ideas and shape our world….”[25] Through this making we construct our identities and communicate ourselves. In the Simulacra, we are making ‘nothing.’ We are solving ‘nothing.’ We are communicating ‘nothing.’ We are ‘nothing.’
The art of making is not ‘nothing.’ It is something. It is in the presence of ignorance that making becomes ‘nothing.’[26] The nomadic cyborg is the true maker “turn[ing] to comprehension and competence and away from ignorance and consumption.”[27] Much like how the art of cinema could not exist unless cinematography died, the art of making cannot exist unless ‘nothing’ ceases to exist. The maker of ‘nothing’ is like the cinematographer “a herd of junkmen doing rather well peddling their rags…”[28] Vertov refers to the true creators of film as kinoks. They use technology as a tool to shape their vision, rather than falling victim to the technological awe. For kinoks, making comes from a control of the technology, using it to shape their vision, not letting it control what the outcome will be. Kinoks partake in the art of making. They do not make ‘nothing.’ Here in the multimedia Simulacra, the nomadic cyborg acts as a kinoks; through their manipulation of the technology, they aim to control the Spectacle.
The nomadic cyborg is the nomad of the Simulacra; moving between the fractals of this Post-Cartesian, interspecies, time-matrix. They are the seekers of divination. Using their ‘all-seeing-eye’ to seize control of the deterministic chaos that is the Simulacra. The nomadic cyborg is the maker of the physical, as well as the digital. They do not limit themselves with a stifling fear of technology. Like the kinoks, they embrace technology, careful to not be swept away by its awe; maintaining control.[29]
The nomadic cyborg and the maker of ‘nothing’ are inhabitants of the Simulacra. Invisible to the hypnotic eye, the nomadic cyborg goes unnoticed. The nomadic cyborg is a simulation of the maker of ‘nothing,’ but they do not make ‘nothing.’ The deterministic eye of the nomadic cyborg comes from their consciousness. They see in all dimensions. Aware of the ‘nothingness’ that drives the Spectacle.
The Spectacle is forever in a state of flux. Fueled by lies and ‘nothingness,’ it thirst for content; data: numerical bi-products of your ‘nothingness.’ The Spectacle is well versed in the art of manipulation, transforming your ‘nothing’ into a hypnotic-trance.[30] You are enslaved to the Spectacle, but you are also enslaved to yourself. Like the Spectacle, you have “attempted to understand activity by means of the categories of vision.”[31] This makes you weak. This makes the Spectacle weak.
'But the Spectacle is not merely a matter of images, nor even of images plus sounds. It is whatever escapes people’s activity, whatever eludes their practical reconsideration and correction. It is the opposite of dialogue. Wherever representation becomes independent, the Spectacle (sic.)regenerates itself.'[32]
The root of the Spectacle is power.[33] Your weakness is the Spectacles strength. Your strength is the Spectacles weakness. The Spectacle is the oppressor, and we, creative cyborgs, are the oppressed. Pablo Freire says that in order for the oppressed to overcome their oppressor, there must be a revolution; after which, the oppressed will become the oppressor.[34] We will enter a never-ending cycle of a shifting dynamic. This is our history. We, the creative cyborgs, and the Spectacle exist in flux with one-another. We are in a continual combatted state with the Spectacle. With each shift in dynamic the Spectacle grows stronger, and we, the creative cyborgs, fall further and further into its trance.
We are on the path of ‘nothingness,’ falling into the abyss of the monotony of ‘nothing.’ Some believe that we should stop making. They fear technology, claiming that we need to revolt against it. But the ‘nothing’ exists within the dematerialized Simulacra. It is a fractal that exists in flux. To stop making would be irrelevant. The Simulacra would still exist. The Spectacle would still exist. The ‘nothing’ would continue to grow.
The nomadic cyborg is in a state of diffusion, moving from areas of high concentration to low concentration within the Simulacra. They are outliers of the Spectacle, which is shaped by the bell curves of the ‘nothing.’ They exist as a statistical anomaly. Like the nomad moves from one place to another seeking fresh resources, the nomadic cyborg seeks untraversed terrains of the multi-planar Simulacra; diverging from the status quo.
For the Spectacle, everything is numerical, a series of ones and zeros. All of the ‘nothingness’ from the maker of ‘nothing’ is reduced to a sequence of binary code. The Spectacle analyzes this code, constructing it into datasets searching for the significant. The nomadic cyborg seeks the insignificant. They search for the permeable spaces of the Spectacle, where the nomadic cyborg is able to move through the boundaries of time, existing between the fractals.
The Simulacra is an illusion;[35] it is magic. An illusion is an illusion because the truth is unknown. In the absence of the explainable, we divert to the logical. Illusions can be unraveled through truth. In revealing those truths, we can demystify the Spectacle in the eye of the maker of ‘nothing.’ The question is how do we discover the truth among the abyss of the ‘nothing?’ How do we capture the eye of the maker of ‘nothing,’ awakening them from their unconscious existence?
The binary system which is the language of the Spectacle, is a descendent of Africa, it is ingrained within the DNA of its culture.[36] Much like the Simulacra, the practice of divination within African culture is a system of deterministic chaos. Therefore, the nomadic cyborg must become a master of alchemy and ancient magic, so that they may reveal the unrevealed. They must use their knowledge of alchemy to become hackers of the Simulacra. But for the nomadic cyborgs, hacking is not ‘hacking’ it is existing beyond the scope of the system — reshaping the system to fit your purpose — it is the manipulation and transforming of it. For the nomadic cyborg, the art of making has become synonymous with the art of hacking.[37]
To be a nomadic cyborg is to understand materiality and immateriality. It is to understand everything and ‘nothing’ at the same time. It is to be singular and plural in existence. It is to be in control, yet out of control. It is to be the oppressed and the oppressor. It is to exist everywhere, yet nowhere. It is to be dialectic in existence. But, most importantly, to be a nomadic cyborg is to understand the power of nothing.

This property is called ‘Self-Similarity.’” Fractals are complex mathematical structures that are the same at all scales. The entire infrastructure of the natural environment is composed of a series of fractals. Although complex by nature, a fractal is simple to make, they are constructed through repeating a simple process over and over again.

As a part of society, it is ostensibly the focal point of all vision and all consciousness. But due to the very fact that this sector is separate, it is in reality the domain of delusion and false consciousness: the unification it achieves is nothing but an official language of universal separation.'
